                <h2>Roundabout sign </h2>
                <p>The sign shown in the image is a circular traffic sign with a blue background and three white arrows forming a clockwise loop. 
                    This sign indicates that drivers must follow the direction of traffic flow in a roundabout as specified. Its main function is to guide traffic 
                    in the roundabout to move smoothly and safely. By following the designated turning direction, drivers can avoid collisions or confusion when 
                    passing through the roundabout. This sign is typically installed before or at the entrance of a roundabout to ensure that all road users
                    understand the traffic pattern that applies in that area.

                <h2>Mandatory right turn</h2>
                <p>TThe “mandatory right turn” sign is a traffic directive that instructs drivers to make a right turn at a specific point in the road. This sign 
                    is typically circular with a blue background and features a white arrow pointing to the right. It is classified as a regulatory sign, meaning that 
                    all drivers must comply with its instruction. The sign is commonly placed at intersections, junctions, or road segments where turning right is the only permitted or 
                    safest option—such as one-way streets or areas with restricted access. Its primary purpose is to guide traffic flow efficiently, prevent confusion, and enhance road safety 
                    by ensuring that vehicles follow a designated path. Ignoring this sign can lead to traffic violations or accidents, making it essential for drivers to recognize and obey it.

                <h2>Stop sign</h2>
                <p>A pedestrian crossing sign is a traffic warning sign that indicates a designated area where pedestrians are allowed to cross the road safely. 
                    This sign is typically rectangular or diamond-shaped with a yellow or blue background and features a symbol of a person walking, often shown 
                    on a zebra crosswalk. Its primary purpose is to alert drivers to slow down and yield to pedestrians who may be crossing, especially in areas near schools,
                     shopping centers, or public transportation stops. The presence of this sign helps reduce accidents and ensures that both drivers and pedestrians are aware of 
                     shared road responsibilities. It plays a vital role in promoting road safety and encouraging orderly movement in urban and residential 
                     environments.</p>

                <h2>Bus stop</h2>
                <p>A bus stop sign is an informational traffic sign that indicates the designated location where buses are allowed to stop for passengers 
                   to board or disembark. This sign is typically rectangular or circular with a blue background and features a symbol of a bus, often accompanied 
                   by the words “Bus Stop.” Its main purpose is to guide both bus drivers and passengers to the correct stopping point, helping to maintain order 
                   and efficiency in public transportation. The presence of this sign ensures that buses do not stop randomly along the road, 
                   which could disrupt traffic flow or pose safety risks. Bus stop signs are commonly found near schools, commercial areas, and public facilities, 
                   and they play a vital role in supporting organized and accessible transit systems.</p>
