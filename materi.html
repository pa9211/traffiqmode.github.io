                <h2>No parking</h2>
                <p>The "no parking" sign is a traffic sign that indicates drivers are not allowed to park their vehicles in a specific area.
                   This sign is usually circular in shape and features the letter "P" crossed out with a red diagonal line. The primary purpose of 
                   this sign is to maintain smooth traffic flow and prevent congestion, especially in vulnerable areas such as 
                   intersections, sidewalks, in front of public facilities, or narrow roads. Although parking is prohibited, 
                   drivers are still allowed to stop briefly as long as they remain in the vehicle—for example, to drop off passengers. 
                   This sign plays an important role in maintaining order and road safety.</p>

                <h2>No truck allowed</h2>
                <p>The “no truck allowed” sign is a traffic sign used to prohibit trucks from passing through or entering certain roads or areas. 
                   This sign is typically circular with a red border and contains a black silhouette of a truck. The main purpose of installing this sign is 
                   to ensure the safety of road users, prevent traffic congestion, and protect road infrastructure that is not designed to handle the weight or size 
                   of large trucks. This sign is often placed in residential areas, narrow roads, tourist zones, or roads with specific conditions such as small bridges and steep inclines.
                   With the presence of this sign, truck drivers are expected to seek alternative routes that are more suitable in order to avoid violating regulations and  endangering other road users.

                <h2>Stop sign</h2>
                <p>A stop sign is a regulatory traffic symbol that instructs drivers to come to a complete halt before proceeding. 
                    It is instantly recognizable by its red, octagonal shape and the bold white letters spelling “STOP.” 
                    This sign is commonly placed at intersections, pedestrian crosswalks, or areas with limited visibility, serving as a crucial 
                    safety measure to prevent accidents and ensure an orderly flow of traffic. When approaching a stop sign, drivers must stop 
                    at the designated line, crosswalk, or just before entering the intersection, and may only continue when the way is clear of 
                    other vehicles, cyclists, or pedestrians. The unique octagonal design of the stop sign helps drivers identify it from any 
                    direction.</p>

                <h2>No entry for buses </h2>
                <p>The "no entry for buses" traffic sign is one used to warn bus drivers not to enter or pass through certain roads. 
                    Typically, the sign is circular with a red border and contains a black silhouette of a bus. It is commonly installed on roads 
                    that are unsuitable for large vehicles like buses, such as narrow streets, tourist areas, residential zones, or roads with challenging 
                    conditions like steep inclines or small bridges. The main purpose of this sign is to ensure road safety, prevent traffic congestion, 
                    and protect road infrastructure from damage caused by heavy vehicles. This sign serves as an important guide for bus drivers to seek 
                    alternative routes that are more appropriate.</p>
